Imports required libraries:

pandas: for reading and handling the dataset

train_test_split: for splitting data into training and test sets

TfidfVectorizer: for converting text into numerical feature vectors

SVC: Support Vector Classifier (SVM algorithm)

classification_report, accuracy_score: to evaluate model performance
Converts the text labels into binary numbers:

ham → 0 (not spam)

spam → 1 (spam)

This is necessary because machine learning models require numeric input.
