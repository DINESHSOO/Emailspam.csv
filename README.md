Email Spam Detection using SVM
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The system is trained on a labeled dataset of emails and extracts text-based features (like frequency of certain words, punctuation, etc.) to make accurate predictions.

🔍 Key Features:
Preprocessing of raw email text (tokenization, stopword removal, vectorization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorizer

Model training using SVM with optimal hyperparameters

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

User-friendly script to test new email samples

🧠 Tools & Libraries:
Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK

🚀 Goal:
To build a reliable and efficient classifier that helps identify spam emails and reduce the risk of phishing or unwanted messages
